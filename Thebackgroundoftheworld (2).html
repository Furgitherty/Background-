    <h1 class="still" style="text-align: center;">How do you create a paragraph?</h1>

    <div class="still">

    <p>To create a paragraph please download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> &#40;for computers&#41;
        or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aor.droidedit&pli=1">DroidEdit</a> &#40;for phones&#41;. </p>

    <p>Then you should make a html file, by pressing "File" then pressing <br>
        "New File" then clicking "Text File" and then right clicking on the name of the file <br>
        and then going to your files and renaming the file you just made to "index.html". 
    </p>

    <p>Now, type in &lt;&#33;DOCTYPE html&gt;. <br>
        Then type in &lt;html&gt;, inside &lt;html&gt; type lang&#61;&#34;en&#34;. <br>
        After that, type in &lt;&#47;html&gt;, which ends the &lt;html&gt; tag (<span id="decorate">a tag is like a keyword that define how webpages display their content there are three main parts of a tag, an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, the opening tag usually starts with a "&lt;" and ends with a "&gt;", the closing tag also starts with a "&lt;" and then a "&#47;", finally the closing tag ends with a "&gt;", the content is whats inbetween the opening and closing tags</span>). <br>
        Then make three spaces between &lt;html&gt; and &lt;&#47;html&gt; so you can type between them, you should also make spaces between every <br>
        tag you type so you can type in between the tags. <br>
        Then type inside of &lt;body&gt; , and then end the &lt;body&gt; tag with typing &lt;&#47;body&gt;. <br>
        Inside the body tag please type &lt;title&gt; and then end with &lt;&#47;title&gt;, <br>
        Inside the title tag please type what you want your website to be named, or leave it blank
    </p>

    <p>Finally, go to the end of the title tag, and make three spaces after it <br>
        Then please type in &lt;p&gt;, and then end the tag with &lt;&#47;p&gt;.
    </p>

    <p>Also always remember to put ";" after you finish typing in content.</p>

    <p>You have now created your own paragraph tag, this is now the end of this tutorial <br>
        thank you for reading this.

    <table>

        <thead>

            <tr>

                <th class="blackcartoon cartoon still">
                    The "p" tag in html:
                </th>

                <th class="blackcartoon cartoon still">
                    The "class" tag in html:
                </th>

                <th class="blackcartoon cartoon still">
                    The "div" tag in html:
                </th>

                <th class="blackcartoon cartoon still">
                    The "span" tag in html:
                </th>

            </tr>

        </thead>

        <tbody>

            <tr>

                <td>
                    The "p" tag, stands for paragraph, and in between the "p" tag you can write your paragraph. <br>
                    The "p" tag defines a block so whatever is in the "p" element is seperate from others.
                </td>

                

                <td>
                    The "class" attribute modifies text in a tag, it is used to alter multiple tags by distributing content inside where it is defined. <br>

                    The "class" attribute can be defined in the "style" tag, which is recommended to be added after the "title" tag, in between the "head"'s opening and closing tags <br>

                    When you add the "style" tag, in between it type "." then a name, after that type "{}"(these are brackets where you put your content in within style), <br>
                    and in between the "{}" you can type different attributes, one is "color" which can be defined by typing, <br>
                    "color" then after that typing the color you would like to choose, then ending the line with ";".

                    You can type "<span class="decorate">class=""</span>" in an opening part of most tags, <br>
                    Then in between the <span class="decorate">""</span>(quotation marks) after "class=" you can type in the name of your class to use your class.
                </td>
                
                <td> 
                    The "div" tag, stands for division, and it does just that, it divides the content inside of it from the content around it. <br>
                    the "div" tag makes a block, which is how it divides what is inside of it from other content, though by itself does nothing, it's different from the "p" tag <br>
                    because the "p" tag represents a paragraph while div represents a division. <br>

                    It is more appropiate and fellow-coder-friendly to use a "div" tag than a "p" tag when seperating an element from others. <br>

                    You can add classes to the "div" tag to customize what is inside the "div" tag
                </td>

                <td>
                    The "span" tag is to modify a part of text in a tag. <br>
                    Its very similar to the "div" tag because you can add classes to the "span" tag, though by itself the "span" tag does nothing <br>
                    however, it does not divide the content inside of it from the content around it. <br>
                    One of the uses of the "span" tag is to change text because it does not divide the content from the content around it.
                </td>
